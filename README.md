## How to Navigate This Repository
### 1. **Start with the Source Code**
   - Navigate to the `3_Implementation/3.1_Source_Code/Monopoly-Hong-Kong-Special-Edition` directory.
   - The following subdirectories are provided to organize the source code and related resources:
     - **`play_game.py`**: The main executable file for running the game.
     - **`assets`**: Contains all multimedia resources, such as images, icons, and animations, used in the game.
     - **`src`**: Implements the game architecture following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.
     - **`tests`**: Includes unit tests and documentation to validate the game’s functionality and ensure reliability.

### 2. **Explore the Reports**
   - The directory contains comprehensive documentation of the project and may located in separated directory:
     - **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**: Outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the project, detailing how users will interact with the game. It serves as a blueprint for ensuring the requirements are valid, consistent, complete, realistic, and verifiable, following specified user stories and guidelines.
     - **Design Document**: Provides detailed diagrams and explanations of the game’s architecture, relationships among key code components, and the workflow of specific gameplay events. It justifies the chosen architectural pattern, describes the structure and interactions between components.
     - **Developer Manual**: A comprehensive guide for developers to understand, maintain, and contribute to the Monopoly Hong Kong Special Edition project. It provides instructions on setting up the development environment, understanding the project structure, and building/running the game in both normal and debugging modes. The manual emphasizes facilitating future development and collaboration.
     - **User Manual**: A comprehensive guide for navigating and utilizing the features of the Monopoly Hong Kong Special Edition game. Designed with a user-friendly interface, it ensures accessibility for all players by detailing the game’s structure and functionality across nine distinct frames. It offers step-by-step instructions for starting or loading a game, customizing the board, managing players, and saving progress, making it an essential reference for maximizing gameplay enjoyment and efficiency.
     - **Requirement Coverage Report**:  Provides a tabular summary of user stories from Appendix C of Course Project Report, indicating which requirements outlined in the SRS have been implemented and which have not. This report serves to track the alignment between the implemented features and the defined requirements, ensuring transparency and completeness in project development.
     - **Unit Test Line Coverage Report**: Declares the percentage of code covered by unit tests in the Monopoly Hong Kong Special Edition project. It includes details on running Python Unit Tests, instructions for replicating the coverage results using the PyCharm IDE, and example unit test code. This report demonstrates the thoroughness of testing and the reliability of the codebase.

### 3. **Review the Gameplay Demo Video and Presentation**
- The `3_Implementation/3.4_Gameplay_Video_Link.txt` contains a Video Link of:
     - Functionality Exploration Demos and Gameplay Demos.

- The `5_Presentation_Slides_and_Recording/5.2_Presentation_Recording_link.txt` contains a Video Link of:
     - Presentation Recording.
